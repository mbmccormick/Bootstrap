Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a simple bootstrapper for Windows Phone applications. It is a template that makes it easy to start build applications, without having to do a lot of legwork. Bootstrap includes many of the common things Windows Phone applications need, such as the Windows Phone Toolkit, efficient error handling, navigation transitions, and more.


Features
========

Bootstrap includes the following features that most Windows Phone applications need:

* Windows Phone Toolkit controls
* RestSharp library
* LittleWatson error handling and reporting
* Visual loading indicator wireup
* Databound list control wireup
* IsolatedStorageHelper for storing and retreiving data
* Prompt for Windows Phone Store review after 3 days

Getting Started
===============

To get started using Bootstrap for a new Windows Phone application, begin by downloading or cloning this repository. Inside the default Bootstrap folder, there is a command called `setup.bat` that will prompt you for your application's name and rename all instances of "Bootstrap" to your application's name. Once the rename is complete, you are ready to start working on the fun part of your Windows Phone application.
